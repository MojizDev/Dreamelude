Game developers typically use a variety of licenses depending on their needs and the way they want others to interact with their game. Here are some common types of licenses used in game development:

### 1. **Proprietary License**
   - **What it is**: This is the most common license for commercial games. The developer retains full ownership and control over the game and its content.
   - **What it means**: Players must purchase or download the game, and they cannot modify, redistribute, or reverse-engineer it.
   - **Examples**: Most AAA games (e.g., Call of Duty, Fortnite).

### 2. **MIT License**
   - **What it is**: A permissive open-source license that allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the game, as long as they include the original copyright and license notice.
   - **What it means**: You can modify and share the game code freely, but you can't hold the author responsible for any issues.
   - **Examples**: Some indie games or tools created by developers who want to encourage contributions and sharing.

### 3. **GNU General Public License (GPL)**
   - **What it is**: A strong open-source license that allows anyone to modify and redistribute the game code. However, any modified version of the game must also be licensed under GPL.
   - **What it means**: If someone modifies your game and distributes it, they must make their changes publicly available under the same GPL license.
   - **Examples**: Often used in projects that encourage collaborative open development (e.g., open-source game engines like Godot).

### 4. **Creative Commons (CC) Licenses**
   - **What it is**: These licenses allow the developer to retain ownership of the work but give others the right to use, share, and sometimes modify it under certain conditions. There are different types, ranging from very permissive (CC BY) to more restrictive (CC BY-NC-ND).
   - **What it means**: You can specify how others can use your game, artwork, sound, or other assets.
   - **Examples**: Used for games or assets (like music or graphics) that the creator wants to allow others to use but with specific rules.

### 5. **Unlicense or Public Domain Dedication**
   - **What it is**: A license where the developer gives up all rights to the game and places it in the public domain.
   - **What it means**: Anyone can do anything with the game (use, modify, redistribute, even commercially) without restrictions.
   - **Examples**: Rare but sometimes used by developers who want to make their games completely free to use by anyone.

### 6. **End User License Agreement (EULA)**
   - **What it is**: A legal contract between the developer and the player. This is usually included in proprietary or commercial games.
   - **What it means**: Players agree to terms regarding how they can use the game (often includes restrictions on modifications, distribution, or resale).
   - **Examples**: Found in almost all paid games (e.g., Steam, Epic Games Store).
